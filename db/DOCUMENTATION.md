# Database scheme [WIP]

Current database scheme proposal is in `studis_db.mwb`. To open and edit file, 
use [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). **CURRENT VERSION IS NOT FINAL!!! DO NOT USE THIS AS REFERENCE
FOR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT. IT MIGHT NOT REPRESENT CURRENT SCHEME**

## Database creation and test data
1. Open folder `init`.
2. Create database and needed tables with `studis.sql`
3. Populate newly created database with test data `populate-db.sql`
